            A pluvial flood occurs when an extreme rainfall event creates a flood independent of an overflowing water body.
             A common misconception about flood is that you must be located near a body of water to be at risk. Yet pluvial flooding can happen in any location, 
             urban or rural, even in areas with no nearby bodies of water
